            A lonely walk?
            Negroes view campus
            with mixed emotions

            By HOLLACE GOLDBERG

            "I was shaving in the dorm one
            day," related a Negro boy, "and
            I cut myself. A friend who was
            sitting nearby joked with me
            and said, ‘Gee, I didn’t know you
            had red blood. My mother al-
            ways told me it was blue.’"

            Turning to his friend, the
            Negro youth replied, "Now that
            you see it’s red, think of all the
            other lies your mother might
            have told you."

            This is what the Negro some
            times encounters on campus.
            But he knows that a jovial return
            or a friendly innuendo may serve
            to enlighten a white person’s
            attitudes and teach him what the
            black man is like and what he is
            not like.

            Negroes on campus who mix
            socially and academically with
            whites and also stay away from
            large associations of Negroes
            feel that they are recognized as
            students--not as "Negro" stu
            dents. As rapport develops be-
            tween these Negroes and their
            white colleagues, race becomes
            just another topic for <seg ana="#LAND">dormitory</seg>
            bull sessions and jests.

            Two colored girls in Wicomico
            one day plastered Black Power
            signs all over their hall. “It was
            fun," reports prankster Carolyn,
            a freshman from <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, for
            in reply to this stunt, the white
            girls “dressed up in paper bags,
            pretending they were a (Ku Klux)
            Klan."

            The hooded WASPS sprinkled
            perfume on the floor in the shape
            of a cross and set fire to it. “It
            really startled us!" exclaimed
            Carolyn.

            "We kid around a lot in the
            dorm," related Bronwyn, a junior.
            "We sing 'We Shall Overcome.'"
            Songs and jokes, she says, don’t
            offend her, for she does not "look
            on the bad side about what other
            people say about me."

            Some other Negro students find
            adjustment to College Park diffi-
            cult. Betty, who is 28 years old,
            married and a native of Cali-
            fornia, finds an “extremely
            hostile" attitude about the
            campus. “There are certain
            vibrations you can feel."

            Betty recalls an incident she
            had with an advisor. During
            registration week, she went to
            him twice with scheduling dilem-
            mas. “He was very nasty," she
            recalled, biting her lower lip and
            widening her very expressive
            eyes. “I told him I had to take
            this <seg ana="#EDU">course</seg>. He threw my (drop
            add) slip at me... I thought it
            was terribly unprofessional for
            an advisor to extend this sort of
            treatment."

            Betty feels that her race did
            play a causative factor toward
            this discourteous treatment. “I
            do have a basis for comparison,"
            she explained. She was raised
            in an integrated community, has
            traveled through Europe with her
            husband, attended San Francisco
            State College and Hunter College
            and interdated in her high school
            and earlier college years.

            "I find It extremely difficult to estab-
            lish any form of communication with
            some of the teachers and advisors here,"
            she said. “Students, basically, are
            friendly, receptive, and warm. But, in
            some instances, there is hesitancy... I
            don't think they know how to respond to
            a Negro."

            Betty has run into trouble securing
            rides from the commuters' carpool serv-
            ice. A few times, she was able to arrange
            rides over the telephone. However,
            when she met her future commuting
            companions they would frequently “begin
            to make excuses," and Betty had no
            ride.

            Resulting from her academic and
            social contacts, Betty concludes that,
            “When you are brought up in an inte-
            grated situation, you act as an individual.
            You are not Negro or white. But here
            ... in the South... and on this campus
            ... I feel I am treading on white man's
            territory... This is the first time I
            feel Negro."

            Also noting a discernible line between
            the races, but holding a different view
            point is a 28 year-old male student who
            works full time off campus.

            What's so overwhelming about feeling
            like a Negro, he questioned. “Isn't
            there a distinction" between Negroes and
            whites?

            With a wholly different frame of mind
            is Harry, a lively, congenial sophomore
            who commutes to school and takes photo-
            graphs for campus publications. “I am
            not a Negro on a white campus!" he
            asserts.

            "I don't think this is a white campus
            ... and I don't go for this stuff that the
            Negro doesn’t have as much chance as
            everyone else out here. He does."

            A native of Wisconsin and formerly a
            nine-year resident of Little Rock, Ark.,
            Harry says, “Because of the way my
            family brought me up... I have never
            felt inferior to anybody. Some Negroes
            do feel inferior. Some feel mid way."

            A Negro who feels cunningly daring is
            Dave. Dave has skin brown as chocolate,
            teeth white as snow and a smile that
            signals immediate rapport with his
            environment.

            “Maryland is a conservative campus,"
            he notes. “You can’t very well walk out
            of your race. I was told a lot of tales
            before I came here. ‘You can’t do this.
            You can’t do that.’ I feel, though, that
            there is an atmosphere here and an
            opportunity to participate in just about
            anything."

            Dave has been active in dormitory
            sports, house rules committee, powder
            puff football, dormitory parties and
            homecoming preparations.

            Socially, Dave goes out with whites
            and Negroes. “I've gone steady with
            white girls, Jewish girls," he said,
            adding, “I guess I am a gregarious
            fellow. I interrelate easily." “But I
            use my intellect before I jump. Every
            one gets slapped in the face a few times.
            So you use some discretion."

            In class, for example, “If your grade
            is tottering... and your prof talks with
            a little bit of a Southern accent... you
            don’t talk to Sally during the lecture."

            Two female Negro students, however,
            disagree with Dave’s classroom obser-
            vation. “If you prove yourself to the
            teacher," feels Bronwyn, “there is noth
            ing the teacher can do against you."

            “I have encountered nothing (prejudi
            cial) whatsoever," related Kathleen, a
            junior majoring in marketing and a
            transfer student from the University of
            Maryland in Munich, Germany. “I have
            yet to find an inkling that such a thing
            exists as far as teaching is concerned."

            Rich, a 26 year-old Business Student
            recalls, “There were a couple of courses
            I have taken here where I felt I had
            gotten a raw deal... I have only run
            across two professors I can really sit
            down and talk to here in BPA."

            Betty, the attractive housewife-student
            from California agrees. “I don’t expect
            to get the benefit of the doubt if I am
            borderline."

            Discussing classroom interaction
            among students, some Negroes find they
            are stared at if race is discussed during
            a lecture. Other Negroes notice nothing
            of the sort.

            "The kids don’t stare at me. They
            don’t even look up," laughed a pretty
            Junior who commutes to school from
            Laurel. “If they do, I don’t catch them
            staring!"

            “Sometimes it hits me that I am the
            only Negro in a class," relates another
            Negro. "It doesn't make me shrink. I
            am always working harder because I
            always feel I have to prove myself to
            white people. I have to show them that I
            live as well as they do, maybe better.
            I am not a dumb, ignorant Negro. I feel
            that I have to prove this to them."

            Though the Negroes on campus have
            different experiences and perceptions to
            relate, they generally agree on one com-
            mon theme. As one freshman comment
            ed, “When you have more and more
            contact with Negro people, then you
            don’t have as many preconceptions. Why?
            Because the preconceptions all fall
            apart."
