            I cut myself. A friend who was<lb/>

            a freshman from <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, for<lb/>

            finds an “extremely<lb/>

            </p>
            <p>
            <persName>Betty</persName> recalls an incident she<lb/>
            had <interp ana="#EDU">with an advisor</interp>. During<lb/>
            registration week, she went to<lb/>
            him twice with scheduling <choice><orig>dilem-
            mas</orig><reg>dilemmas</reg></choice>.<lb/>
            “He was very nasty," she<lb/>
            recalled, biting her lower lip and<lb/>
            widening her very expressive<lb/>
            eyes. “I told him I had to take<lb/>
            this course. He threw my (drop<lb/>
            add) slip at me... I thought it<lb/>
            was terribly unprofessional for<lb/>
            an advisor to extend this sort of<lb/>
            treatment."
            </p>
            <p>
            <persName>Betty</persName> feels that her race did<lb/>
            play a causative factor toward<lb/>
            this discourteous treatment. “I<lb/>
            do have a basis for comparison,"<lb/>
            she explained. She was raised<lb/>
            in an integrated community, has<lb/>
            traveled through <placeName>Europe</placeName> with her<lb/>
            husband, attended <orgName>San Francisco<lb/>
            State College</orgName> and <orgName>Hunter College</orgName><lb/>
            and interdated in her high school<lb/>
            and earlier college years.
            </p>
            <p>
            "I find it extremely difficult to <choice><orig>estab-
            lish</orig><reg>establish</reg></choice><lb/>
            any form of communication with<lb/>
            some of the teachers and advisors here,"<lb/>
            she said. “Students, basically, are<lb/>
            friendly, receptive, and warm. But, in<lb/>
            some instances, there is hesitancy... I<lb/>
            don't think they know how to respond to<lb/>
            <persName ref="#BLK">a Negro</persName>."
            </p>
            <p>
            <persName>Betty</persName> has run into trouble securing<lb/>
            rides from the commuters' carpool <choice><orig>serv-
            ice</orig><reg>service</reg></choice>.<lb/>
            A few times, she was able to arrange<lb/>
            rides over the telephone. However,<lb/>
            when she met her future commuting<lb/>
            companions they would frequently “begin<lb/>
            to make excuses," and <persName>Betty</persName> had no<lb/>
            ride.
            </p>
            <p>
            Resulting from her academic and<lb/>
            social contacts, <persName>Betty</persName> concludes that,<lb/>
            “When you are brought up in an <choice><orig>inte-
            grated</orig><reg>integrated</reg></choice><lb/>
            situation, you act as an individual.<lb/>
            You are not Negro or white. But here<lb/>
            ... in the South... and <seg corresp="#UMD">on this campus</seg><lb/>
            ... I feel I am treading on white man's<lb/>
            <interp ana="#LAND">territory</interp>... This is the first time I<lb/>
            feel Negro."
            </p>
            <p>
            Also noting a discernible line between<lb/>
            the races, but holding a different view<lb/>
            point is a <measure type="age" quantity="28" unit="year">28 year-old</measure> <persName>male student</persName> who<lb/>
            works full time off campus.
            </p>
            <p>
            What's so overwhelming about feeling<lb/>
            like a Negro, he questioned. “Isn't<lb/>
            there a distinction" between Negroes and<lb/>
            whites?
            </p>
            <p>
            With a wholly different frame of mind<lb/>
            is <persName>Harry</persName>, a lively, congenial sophomore<lb/>
            who commutes to school and takes <choice><orig>photo-
            graphs</orig><reg>photographs</reg></choice><lb/>
            for campus publications. “I am<lb/>
            not a Negro on a white campus!" he<lb/>
            asserts.
            </p>
            <p>
            "I don't think <seg corresp="#UMD">this is a white campus</seg><lb/>
            ... and I don't go for this stuff that <persName ref="#BLK">the<lb/>
