            The Negro on campus
            Racial issues down since 1954

            By HOLLACE GOLDBERG

            Since the Supreme Court’s
            school desegregation decision in
            1954, the University has slowly
            dropped all racial tones from its
            hiring, housing and admissions
            policies.

            In 1964 the Board of Regents
            ordered that questions of race
            be deleted from application
            forms. A student's race could
            be requested only after he had
            been admitted to the University,
            and then only for statistical pur-
            poses.

            The housing office also deleted
            race questions from its forms,
            but continued to request pictures
            of students seeking dormitory
            rooms. Negro students felt this
            was done to avoid inter-racial
            room assignments. Though such
            a policy was never spelled out,
            observation indicated this to be
            true.

            Under housing policies initiat-
            ed this fall, no student’s picture
            is requested. Housing Director
            Margaret Lloyd said that previous
            housing directors might have
            used the pictures to match up
            Negro roommates, but her
            present policy forbids such “sub-
            jective" assignments.
            “It is my determination that
            we eliminate anything that smacks
            of discrimination," Miss Lloyd
            declared. “I can’t see that the
            color of the skin has anything
            more to do with a person than
            the color of their hair."

            Roommates, she explained, are
            at present matched objectively.
            “If you don’t request a room-
            mate and a hall, you are assigned
            by electronic data processes."
            The computer, she noted, is a
            “random" not a “racial" machine.

            If a white student rooming with
            a Negro complains of “roommate
            incompatibility" due to race, Miss
            Lloyd handles this complaint
            much as she would any other. The
            students are asked to try to work
            things out. But if the situation
            remains unstatisfactory, the
            "complaining student is moved."
            Miss Lloyd added that such
            problems are often “more pa-
            rental than student," and arise
            infrequently.

            Off-campus housing is another
            matter. Negroes have always
            had difficulty securing rooms
            and apartments near campus.
            According to the testimony of
            Bill Jonas, a commuter, he and
            another Negro submitted an ap-
            plication in person for an apart-
            ment, leaving a $5O room deposit.
            Hearing no word after a month,
            “we called H.G. Smithy Realtors
            and they in turn said ‘hold on a
            minute.' No one ever came back
            to the phone," related Jones.

            "A week later, we received
            (through the mall) our request for
            application—-denied. We called,
            and a week later our check came
            back. We had no time to raise
            any issues about it.

            "After that, well, I Just stayed
            in Washington with my aunt."

            According to off-campus hous-
            ing director Doyal P. Royal, the
            University aids students seeking
            off-campus housing by keeping a
            "public list of public facilities."
            However, until last July that list
            included many houses and apart-
            ments that were closed to colored
            students.

            Months of protests, picket lines,
            pressure groups and politics
            forced the University to revise
            its “public" list over the summer
            of 1966. A new form, sent out
            to area landlords, stated:
            “We cannot accept your listing
            if your only reason for not accept-
            ing the student is because of race,
            color, national origin or reli-
            gion."

            Reflecting on the new policy,
            Royal said, “Last summer we
            decided to try to please every-
            body and neutralize the card."
            As a result, last year's 400-
            apartment list has dwindled.
            "Only one large apartment house
            remains on the list," he said.

            Removed from housing office
            policies is the University's ath-
            letics program. In his depart-
            ment, asserted Director of
            Athletics William W. Cobey, “the
            policy has been simply that any
            student enrolled at the University
            is welcome to come out for
            athletics." Ball players are not
            chosen by their color, they must
            qualify academically and athleti
            cally.

            Furthermore, the athletic de-
            partment keeps no record of an
            athlete’s race. Cobey could not
            recall the date when the first
            Negro athlete competed for the
            University in intercollegiate var-
            sity ball. However, a perusal
            of Terrapin yearbooks shows that
            the swim team was the first to
            integrate, in 1963, with the addi
            tion of Negro swimmer Jason
            Williams.

            The football team followed the
            next year. In fall, 1964, Darryl
            Hill played on the varsity squad.
            Last year in football, Ernie
            Torain played halfback. He was
            joined this year by Alvin Lee,
            also a halfback.

            Bill Jones played basketball
            last year, and this year Pete
            Johnson is also playing on the
            court. The track team has had
            Negro members since last year.

            In another area, the hiring of
            employees, recruitment depends
            largely on state civil service
            requirements.

            The University is an "equal
            opportunity" employer, reports
            George W. Fogg, director of
            personnel. "We have employed
            everyone (Negro) that is qualified
            for his job. We equalize white
            and Negro... We don’t favor
            either one or the other."
            Answering a query about the
            sparsity of Negro secretaries on
            campus, Fogg frankly conceded,
            “We have a lot of Negro secre-
            taries—-but we have a lot more
            white ones."

            To recruit staff, Fogg's office
            advertises through local newspa-
            pers and employment agencies.
            If applicants meet state civil
            service requirements, they are
            interviewed by the Personnel Of-
            fice. Departments with vacancies
            interview several job candidates
            and choose one to fill the position.
            Once hired, the employees must
            fill out income tax papers, pay
            roll forms and a personal history
            questionnaire. The personal his-
            tory form includes a question on
            race.

            “This is only for statistics,"
            explained Fogg. “We never ask
            this until the person is hired."
            These racial statistics are re-
            quired by the Compliance Com-
            mittee of the State Fair Prac-
            tices Commission. The Univer
            sity must make a report to the
            Commission on the ratio of Negro
            and white employees. The first
            such report, which is presently
            being compiled, is due Jan. 15.

            Hiring of faculty members is
            done largely at the departmental
            level. Nominations are generated
            by the department heads.

            Here, related Fogg, qualifica-
            tions are very specific. Nomi
            nees are interviewed by R.
            Lee Hornbake, vice-president for
            academic affairs, and appoint-
            ments confirmed by the Board
            of Regents.

            Hornbake stated that in re-
            cruiting faculty, “we are not try-
            ing to find people of any race.
            But," he added “qualified Negroes
            are in very short supply, since
            they are being sought after
            eagerly by many instructors."

            He mentioned that two Negroes
            --an African assistant professor
            in G&P and an associate pro-
            fessor of education—-have been
            hired in the past two years to
            teach in College Park. However,
            as for the total number of Negro
            instructors on the University’s
            many campuses, Hornbake said,
            “I don’t know how many there
            are and honestly, I don't care.
            All I am interested in is good
            faculty."

            Hornbake also dlsspelled a
            rumor that has been pervading
            the sociology department for the
            last twelve months. A Negro
            professor nominated by the
            sociology department did not
            complete his contract negotia-
            tions for a position. Rumors,
            however, persisted that the ad-
            ministration had dropped their
            offer due specifically to the ap-
            plicant’s race.

            Hornbake explained what
            happened. The man, a “highly
            recommended" professor of an-
            thropology, told the University
            he had received “another offer
            from a West coast institution."

            “He was a quality man, who
            had been in demand in a variety
            of places," testified Hornbake.
            “I did not infer from him that he
            felt that race had been a factor
            at all, in not accepting the Uni-
            versity bid."

            To learn just how many
            Negroes the University employs
            in College Park, last spring the
            Personnel Office sent to all fac-
            ulty and staff a short personal
            history questionnaire. The data,
            as mentioned before, was being
            compiled for the State Fair Prac-
            tices Commission.

            Resenting racial questions,
            many white faculty members an-
            swered by writing “Eskimo" or
            “mixed." But according to Fogg,
            “this was a misdirected form of
            liberalism. These people hinder-
            ed the cause that they were stand
            ing for."

            The purpose of the survey was
            to indicate that the University
            does comply with the Civil Rights
            Act.
