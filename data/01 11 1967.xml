            <date when="1954">1954</date>, the <orgName ref="#UMD">University</orgName> has slowly<lb/>

            <interp ana="#LAB">hiring</interp>, <interp ana="#LAND">housing</interp> and <interp ana="#EDU">admissions</interp><lb/>
            policies.
            </p>
            <p>
            In <date when="1964">1964</date> the <persName ref="#USM">Board of Regents</persName><lb/>
            ordered that questions of race<lb/>
            be deleted from application<lb/>
            forms. A student's race could<lb/>
            be requested only after he had<lb/>
            been admitted to the <orgName ref="#UMD">University</orgName>,<lb/>
            and then only for statistical <choice><orig>pur-
            poses</orig><reg>purposes</reg></choice>.
            </p>
            <p>
            The <interp ana="#LAND">housing office</interp> also deleted<lb/>
            race questions from its forms,<lb/>
            but continued to request pictures<lb/>
            of students seeking <interp ana="#LAND">dormitory</interp><lb/>
            rooms. Negro students felt this<lb/>
            was done to avoid <choice><orig>inter-racial</orig><reg>interracial</reg></choice><lb/>
            room assignments. Though such<lb/>
            a policy was never spelled out,<lb/>
            observation indicated this to be<lb/>
            true.
            </p>
            <p>
            Under <interp ana="#LAND">housing policies</interp> <choice><orig>initiat-
            ed</orig><reg>initiated</reg></choice><lb/>
            this fall, no student’s picture<lb/>
            is requested. Housing Director<lb/>
            <persName ref="#ML">Margaret Lloyd</persName> said that previous<lb/>
            housing directors might have<lb/>
            used the pictures to match up<lb/>
            Negro roommates, but her<lb/>
            present policy forbids such “<choice><orig>sub-
            jective</orig><reg>subjective</reg></choice>"<lb/>
            assignments.<lb/>
            “It is my determination that<lb/>
            we eliminate anything that smacks<lb/>
            of discrimination," <persName ref="#ML">Miss Lloyd</persName><lb/>
            declared. “I can’t see that the<lb/>
            color of the skin has anything<lb/>
            more to do with a person than<lb/>
            the color of their hair."
            </p>
            <p>
            Roommates, <seg corresp="#ML">she</seg> explained, are<lb/>
            at present matched objectively.<lb/>
            “If you don’t request a <choice><orig>room-
            mate</orig><reg>roommate</reg></choice><lb/>
            and a hall, you are assigned<lb/>
            by electronic data processes."<lb/>
            The computer, she noted, is a<lb/>
            “random" not a “racial" machine.
            </p>
            <p>
            If a white student rooming with<lb/>
            <persName ref="#BLK">a Negro</persName> complains of “roommate<lb/>
            incompatibility" due to race, <persName ref="#ML">Miss<lb/>
            Lloyd</persName> handles this complaint<lb/>
            much as she would any other. The<lb/>
            students are asked to try to work<lb/>
            things out. But if the situation<lb/>
            remains unstatisfactory, the<lb/>
            "<interp ana="#LAND">complaining student is moved</interp>."<lb/>
            <persName ref="#ML">Miss Lloyd</persName> added that such<lb/>
            problems are often “more <choice><orig>pa-
            rental</orig><reg>parental</reg></choice><lb/>
            than student," and arise<lb/>
            infrequently.
            </p>
            <p>
            <interp ana="#LAND">Off-campus housing</interp> is another<lb/>
