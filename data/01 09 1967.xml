            Negroes on white campus
            Apprehension limits racial interaction

            By HOLLACE GOLDBERG
            Third in a series

            What is it like to be a Negro<lb/>
            student on a white campus? Each<lb/>
            Negro student has his own per-<lb/>
            sonal opinion.

            "There’s no difference,“ main<lb/>
            tained one sophomore, “Negro is<lb/>
            just a legal term the white man<lb/>
            made up for convenience."

            “No, our culture is different,"<lb/>
            projected a dark-skinned boy.<lb/>
            "It’s composed of <persName>James Brown</persName><lb/>
            and the Supremes."

            "They stare at me in class when<lb/>
            we discuss slavery or Africa,"<lb/>
            noted one young girl. “I guess<lb/>
            it’s out of curiosity."

            "People yell out of car windows<lb/>
            at me," put in an adamant coed,<lb/>
            cursing the University under her<lb/>
            breath. This was Doris, a dis-<lb/>
            satisfied Negro, bitter towards<lb/>
            her four years at the University.<lb/>
            Doris sells Black power but-<lb/>
            tons, “a quarter for Negroes, a<lb/>
            dollar for whites."

            "You can’t write an article on<lb/>
            Negroes," she told this reporter.<lb/>
            "Anything you write, white people<lb/>
            will think is interesting... but to<lb/>
            colored people it won’t mean a
            thing."

            Only colored people know and<lb/>
            understand colored people, she<lb/>
            maintains. This seems to be<lb/>
            true, for the white student cannot<lb/>
            find a typical Negro student from<lb/>
            which to generalize about the<lb/>
            200-400 colored undergraduates<lb/>
            on campus.

            The Negroes compose a hete-<lb/>
            rogeneous population, demarcat-<lb/>
            ed from the rest of the student<lb/>
            body by skin color and/or a few<lb/>
            tables in the Main Dining Hall<lb/>
            or the Student Union. The Negro<lb/>
            students’ views are varied, their<lb/>
            experiences largely dissimilar,<lb/>
            and even their skin tones are of<lb/>
            different shades.

            This is an article about the<lb/>
            Negro students in the Union. They<lb/>
            comprise an amorphous group of<lb/>
            between 40-50 students who gath-<lb/>
            er in the cafeteria every after<lb/>
            noon to eat, “shoot the breeze”<lb/>
            and play pinochle.

            Who are they? How do they<lb/>
            mingle with white students? These<lb/>
            are glimpses of the experiences<lb/>
            they relate as they sip Cokes<lb/>
            and munch on pizza between<lb/>
            classes.

            Social events is a major topic<lb/>
            these students discuss when<lb/>
            viewing their interaction with<lb/>
            whites.

            “At dorm deserts, I don’t really<lb/>
            fit in,” said Gary, a cool College<lb/>
            Joe who talks fast and smiles a<lb/>
            lot. “They don’t play our kind of<lb/>
            music.”

            “At one desert,” he continued<lb/>
            wryly, “I asked a white girl to<lb/>
            dance. She refused me, so I sat<lb/>
            down.”

            Later, he noticed the girl <choice><orig>danc-<lb/>
            ing</orig><reg>dancing</reg></choice> with white boys. He went over<lb/>
            to her and asked her for the next<lb/>
            record."

            “Her girl friends were pushing<lb/>
            her to dance with me,” he re-<lb/>
            called. “So she did. We danced,<lb/>
            and in the middle of the record<lb/>
            she burst into tears and ran to<lb/>
            her housemother.”

            Deducing a moral from his<lb/>
            story, Gary declared, “I don't<lb/>
            care if they don’t want to dance<lb/>
            with me, I just wish that before<lb/>
            each desert they’d make a list of<lb/>
            girls who won’t dance with me so<lb/>
            I'll know."

            On the whole, Gary encounters<lb/>
            little "open" prejudice in his<lb/>
            dormitory. However, Donna, a<lb/>
            calm, attractive Negro student,<lb/>
            prefers to live at home and com-<lb/>
            mute rather than to room in a<lb/>
            dormitory.

            At summer orientation last<lb/>
            July, she explained, she was the<lb/>
            only Negro in her tour group.<lb/>
            "They were surprised, I guess,<lb/>
            to see a Negro. They said<lb/>
            nothing against me, but they<lb/>
            stared as if they didn’t expect

            Negroes note white preconceptions

            to see a Negro in their group."

            “I used to live in Philadelphia,"<lb/>
            Donna continued. "I was in the<lb/>
            minority... so I got used to the<lb/>
            feeling of being the only one there<lb/>
            and people staring."

            But this feeling is "kind of<lb/>
            lonely," and that was why Donna<lb/>
            “declined living on campus--be<lb/>
            cause of summer orientation."

            "I haven’t had any problems<lb/>
            with any students in class," she<lb/>
            continued. “They even come to<lb/>
            me and ask me for help. They<lb/>
            don’t judge you by your color, but<lb/>
            by what you can do." But Donna
            still prefers to live at home,
            rather than on campus.

            Another commuter, Alphonso,
            was part of a nucleus of Negro
            students who tried to establish
            a “bi-racial" fraternity on cam-
            pus last spring. Plans were made
            to establish Omega Psi Phi, but
            due to a start late in the semes-
            ter, the group was unable to
            start a chapter.

            Meeting ‘awkward’

            “Many people who wanted to
            become charter members com-
            muted from Baltimore," Alphonso
            explained. It was “awkward for
            them to come back for a meeting
            at night." Also, a set sum of
            money had to be laid down within
            a one-week time limit. Gary
            feels that this payment deadline
            prevented the group from gen-
            erating more immediate interest.

            Dwayne, a commuter who
            spends part of each afternoon in
            the Union improving his game of
            pinochle, explained why he would
            like to establish a fraternity.

            “Everybody likes to have some-
            thing when they graduate, a group
            to call back together, a group to
            talk up old times. It’s good to
            be able to come back and look
            at the work you have done."

            He and Alphonso also note
            that a fraternity would give the
            Negro students a chance to par-
            ticipate in Homecoming, to com-
            pete in athletic events, and to
            gain a voice in campus affairs.

            Other Negroes disagree. They
            see little unity in a “bi-racial"
            fraternity, they anticipate that
            Negroes would remain together,
            and this would not alter signifi-
            cantly their present rate of in-
            teraction with whites.

            Another student added that
            although Negroes have been
            “shunner" from “going into fra-
            ternities, “I would not join a
            fraternity simply (only) because
            it was black."

            None of the 24 social frater
            nities on campus are racially
            integrated with whites and Ne-
            groes. The fraternities have
            no discriminatory clauses in
            their charters, but attitudinal
            barriers and apprehensive feel-
            ings seem to bar a Negro from
            pledging a white house.

            These feelings are not fostered
            by white students alone. Negroes
            find they are reluctant to rush
            a white fraternity. They doubt
            that they would be pledged, and
            if they were, they wonder if they
            could be accepted as a brother.

            Also, at parties, could the Ne-
            groes bring white dates without
            offending or shocking the alumni
            and brothers?

            Interdating

            These Negroes do interdate.
            They state that white girls are
            generally more friendly toward
            their race than white boys.

            White people, they note, seem
            very concerned with pressures
            exerted by their friends. Negro
            boys dating white coeds have been
            told that when their dates return
            to the dormitory, every one in
            the hall flocks around them to
            ask questions.

            If a Negro mixes socially with
            whites, however, peer-group re-
            action is minimal. Explained
            Gary, “If you’re in the group,
            you’re in... We don’t care...
            You do what you want to do."

            White girls, they note, expect
            Negro boys to be fast on a date.
            They are surprised when they
            find Negro behavior to the con-
            trary. According to several
            Negro boys, colored girls are
            “a lot more shy than white girls."

            “They don’t do things in pub
            lic," explained one boy. “On the
            Mall, I’ve seen things Negro girls
            won’t do."

            Sorority obstacle

            One thing Negro girls can’t do,
            it seems, is join a sorority.
            Last year, two Negro girls went
            through fall sorority rush. One
            girl received no invitations to
            the second round of parties, but
            the other girl was invited back
            to several houses. However,
            after this second group of par
            ties, that girl was dropped too.

            This year another girl, Sharon,
            signed up for rush. Cute, petite
            and well-dressed, Sharon said
            she went through rush because
            she had taken it for granted that
            “you go to college, and you join
            a sorority."

            “I was disappointed not to see
            some Negroes in the sororities,"
            she said. “Out of 18 sororities,
            you would expect to see one. I
            was shocked. Especially on a
            campus this size. Rush was sup
            posed to be so open and all."

            During rush, she reports,
            “everybody was nice." After open
            house she was invited back to ten
            houses. But for “set of four"
            parties, she received no return
            bids.

            Negroes may join the service
            fraternity and sorority on cam-
            pus. Of the students interviewed,
            one was a member of Gamma Sig-
            ma Sigma sorority. Others were
            members of the marching band,
            P.E Majors Club, the football
            team, and the chess club.

            A perusal through Terrapin
            yearbooks shows that other
            colored students are in Univer-
            sity Theater productions, publi-
            cations staffs, ROTC groups, the
            Nursing Club, the M Club and the
            Pharmacy Club.

            But even in these groups, there
            are only one or two Negro mem-
            bers. The low proportion of
            Negro students on campus is not
            the lone factor preventing large
            Negro participation in campus
            activities.

            The Negroes in the union
            "group" feel that a veil of ap-
            prehension limits Negro-white
            interaction outside of class. This
            cloak of apprehension is the last
            barrier for a Negro student to
            overcome before he will vie for
            acceptance in an all-white group.
            This cloak of apprehension is
            the last barrier that a white
            person must overcome before he
            will forget color, disregard nega-
            tive peer-group reactions and
            boldly sit down at a Negro table
            in the Union.

            Part of Friday’s installment
            was incorrectly organized to
            due a mechanical mistake.
            The Diamondback regrets the
            error.
