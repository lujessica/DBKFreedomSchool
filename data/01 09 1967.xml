            <p>
            This is an article about the<lb/>

            <p>
            Who are they? How do they<lb/>
            mingle with white students? These<lb/>
            are glimpses of the experiences<lb/>
            they relate as they sip Cokes<lb/>
            and munch on pizza between<lb/>
            classes.

            <p>
            Social events is a major topic<lb/>
            these students discuss when<lb/>

            whites.
            </p>
            <p>
            “At dorm deserts, I don’t really<lb/>
            fit in,” said <persName xml:id="GARY">Gary</persName>, a cool College<lb/>
            Joe who talks fast and smiles a<lb/>
            lot. “They don’t play our kind of<lb/>
            music.”
            </p>
            <p>
            “At one desert,” <seg corresp="#GARY">he</seg> continued<lb/>
            wryly, “I asked a white girl to<lb/>
            dance. She refused me, so I sat<lb/>
            down.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Later, <seg corresp="#GARY">he</seg> noticed the girl <choice><orig>danc-
            ing</orig><reg>dancing</reg></choice><lb/>
            with white boys. <seg corresp="#GARY">He</seg> went over<lb/>
            to her and asked her for the next<lb/>
            record."
            </p>
            <p>
            “Her girl friends were pushing<lb/>
            her to dance with <seg corresp="#GARY">me</seg>,” <seg corresp="#GARY">he</seg> <choice><orig>re-
            called</orig><reg>recalled</reg></choice>.<lb/>
            “So she did. We danced,<lb/>
            and in the middle of the record<lb/>
            she burst into tears and ran to<lb/>
            her housemother.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Deducing a moral from his<lb/>
            story, <persName ref="#GARY">Gary</persName> declared, “I don't<lb/>
            care if they don’t want to dance<lb/>
            with me, I just wish that before<lb/>
            each desert they’d make a list of<lb/>
            girls who won’t dance with me so<lb/>
            I'll know."
            </p>
            <p>
            On the whole, <persName ref="#GARY">Gary</persName> encounters<lb/>
            little "open" prejudice in his<lb/>
            <interp ana="#LAND">dormitory</interp>. However, <persName xml:id="DONNA">Donna</persName>, a<lb/>

            prefers to <interp ana="#LAND">live at home</interp> and <choice><orig>com-

            rather than to room in a<lb/>
            dormitory.
            </p>
            <p>
            At summer orientation last<lb/>
