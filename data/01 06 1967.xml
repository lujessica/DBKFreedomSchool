            <p>
            The conclusion was “yes, there ought<lb/>

            <persName ref="#PJM">Mitchell</persName>’s favor, declaring that “counsel<lb/>

            into “Negro Higher Education in the<lb/>

            <interp ana="#EDU">Negro and white educational facilities</interp>,<lb/>
            the Committee proposed that the “State<lb/>

            The <persName ref="#USM">Board of Regents</persName> examined<lb/>

            April, <date when="1951">1951</date>, the <persName ref="#USM">Board</persName> promulgated a new<lb/>
            racial policy:

            <p>
            <interp ana="#EDU">In the future all resident applicants</interp><lb/>
            within the state, regardless of race, color<lb/>

            </p>
            <p>
            In line with this policy ruling, in<lb/>
            May of that year, <measure type="number" quantity="2">two</measure> Negroes were <choice><orig>ad-

            for several months, until another<lb/>

            The <orgName ref="#UMD">University</orgName> apologized to <persName ref="#WAP">Paris</persName>,<lb/>
            but informed that <interp ana="#EDU">the school’s policy</interp> of<lb/>

            In <date when="1955">1955</date> a similar incident occurred.<lb/>

            that <seg corresp="#UMD">the school</seg> did not admit out-of-state<lb/>
