             Interdating
             The Negro point of view

             By HOLLACE GOLDBERG
             Last in a series

             I am a boy. I am a girl. My
             skin is a shade darker and my
             hair a bit thicker than most
             students. I play the dating game
             differently too. I am a Negro
             who has become integrated into
             the fabric of the University, and
             I stay aloof from all-Negro social
             cliques. People who share my
             perspective often hold similar,
             though not identical points of
             view.

             “I think white girls are de-
             finitely more friendly than white
             boys,” related a pretty young
             freshman. “I feel that white
             girls are particularly friendly
             with Negro boys. There is such
             a limited amount of Negro boys
             that this really gets on my
             nerves.”

             “That’s typical female jeal-
             ousy,” laughed a Negro boy, hear
             ing these comments. But the
             attractive coed had more to say.

             "If it was a fair interchange,
             I might not mind,” she said.
             “But white boys show little in-
             terest in Negro girls, I have
             the distinct feeling,” she said,
             “that when a white boy sees an
             attractive Negro girl, it crosses
             his mind that she is Negro” and
             he then pays no further attention
             to her.

             “They must have some particu-
             lar impression that Negro girls
             are dirty and ignorant. I’ve
             really tried to figure out the
             mental processes involved be-
             cause you can’t tell me that
             boys won’t recognize a nice look-
             ing girl right away.”

             On the other side of the dating
             game is Dave, also a Negro. He
             notes that often white girls exer-
             cise a certain friendliness to-
             ward him, but he exercises some
             caution in interdating.

             “You can ask a girl out right
             away--if you like getting shot
             down!” he commented. “But most
             of the time in your associations
             you basically know who would
             (go out with you) and who
             wouldn’t,” he said. If a Negro
             boy and a white girl get to know
             each other and build up an ex-
             change, “you ask her out then.”

             Among the students interview-
             ed, boys have interdated more
             frequently than girls. One coed
             who has been asked out by white
             boys has always “declined. I
             might feel a little strange,” she
             explained, “but the person I am
             with might feel worse.”

             "My father just wouldn’t ap-
             prove,” offered another coed.
             “I am not going to say ‘No, I
             never will interdate.’ If it comes
             along, I might. But... I think
             the chances are less for me
             than for a Negro boy.”

             Most of these Negroes have
             definite views about the colored
             students who sit together in the
             Main Dining Hall and in the Stu-
             dent Union. “It’s sociological,”
             explained one Negro. “These
             kids, for the most part, come
             from schools where there were
             90 per cent Negroes. They have
             never been in an integrated en-
             vironment and therefore remain
             together here.”

             “They're mostly commuters
             (in the Union)," analyzed an-
             other. “They just go to the Union
             because there is really nothing
             else for them to do in between
             classes--except to study. You
             can’t do that all the time, and
             it is nice to relax in the Union.”

             "To me, the Student Union
             Negro is the Negro that every
             body expects to see,” asserted
             a Negro coed with much resent-
             ment. “I don’t go to the Union,”
             she continued. "I don’t care to
             classify myself. I find it posi-
             tively revolting. All my people
             are congregated in one section
             playing pinochle, laughing and
             talking.

             "When I sit with the Negroes
             in the dining hall," she added,
             "they make me feel more like a
             Negro than white people do."
             A Negro clique, she said, im-
             plies that "the white world has
             me down and I have to go hunt
             up my people.”

             "I picked the University of
             Maryland as opposed to Negro
             colleges in Baltimore. I still
             have to live in a white man’s
             world, therefore I have to learn
             to live with them. The only way
             you can let people know that you
             are like them is to associate
             with them."

             Negro students who spend their

             Negro should 'learn to live' in white world

             time in the Union, however, dis-
             agree with these viewpoints.
             "These were my friends in high
             school,” professed one boy. "I
             came to college and stayed with
             them. It’s natural to stay with
             people you know. Many white
             students segregate themselves,
             too, and only stay with people
             they associated with prior to
             college.”

             The Negro community on cam-
             pus is not homogeneous in ideas--
             nor can the Negro community
             be considered an identifiable sub-
             group. Some Negro students
             stay segregated. Others inte-
             grate to varying degrees. Like
             all individuals, each Negro has
             a distinct set of opinions. Even
             college holds a different place
             in each one’s scheme of values.

             "I think college is a place
             where you do a lot of learning,"
             expressed one Negro. "All your
             life you have been taught this and
             that. Now your intellect begins
             to take over... You learn whether
             it was all a big hoax."

             In this generation, he reflected,
             there are many opportunities for
             whites and Negroes to interre-
             late, many more opportunities
             than "our parents” had. Inter-
             racial contact stimulates thought
             and discussion.

             "Sooner or later I hope every-
             body will be one big happy family
             —-all mixed up. Things could
             really swing,” one Negro sug-
             gested. “Or, then again, we
             could have a recession.”
