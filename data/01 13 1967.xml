             I am a boy. I am a girl. My<lb/>
             skin is a shade darker and my<lb/>
             hair a bit thicker than most<lb/>
             students. I play the dating game<lb/>
             differently too. I am a Negro<lb/>
             who has become integrated into<lb/>
             the fabric of the University, and<lb/>
             I stay aloof from all-Negro social<lb/>
             cliques. People who share my<lb/>
             perspective often hold similar,<lb/>
             though not identical points of<lb/>
             view.

             “I think white girls are <choice><orig>de-
             finitely</orig><reg>definitely</reg></choice><lb/>
             more friendly than white<lb/>
             boys,” related a pretty young<lb/>
             freshman. “I feel that white<lb/>
             girls are particularly friendly<lb/>
             with Negro boys. There is such<lb/>
             a limited amount of Negro boys<lb/>
             that this really gets on my<lb/>
             nerves.”
             </p>
             <p>
             “That’s typical female <choice><orig>jeal-
             ousy</orig><reg>jealousy</reg></choice>,”<lb/>
             laughed a Negro boy, <choice><orig>hear-
             ing</orig><reg>hearing</reg></choice><lb/>
             these comments. But the<lb/>
             attractive coed had more to say.
             </p>
             <p>
             "If it was a fair interchange,<lb/>
             I might not mind,” she said.<lb/>
             “But white boys show little <choice><orig>in-
             terest</orig><reg>interest</reg></choice><lb/>
             in Negro girls, I have<lb/>
             the distinct feeling,” she said,<lb/>
             “that when a white boy sees an<lb/>
             attractive Negro girl, it crosses<lb/>
             his mind that she is Negro” and<lb/>
             he then pays no further attention<lb/>
             to her.
             </p>
             <p>
             “They must have some <choice><orig>particu-
             lar</orig><reg>particular</reg></choice><lb/>
             impression that Negro girls<lb/>
             are dirty and ignorant. I’ve<lb/>
             really tried to figure out the<lb/>
             mental processes involved <choice><orig>be-
             cause</orig><reg>because</reg></choice><lb/>
             you can’t tell me that<lb/>
             boys won’t recognize a nice <choice><orig>look-
             ing</orig><reg>looking</reg></choice><lb/>
             girl right away.”
             </p>
             <p>
             On the other side of the dating<lb/>
             game is Dave, also a Negro. He<lb/>
             notes that often white girls <choice><orig>exer-
             cise</orig><reg>exercise</reg></choice><lb/>
             a certain friendliness <choice><orig>to-
             ward</orig><reg>toward</reg></choice><lb/>
             him, but he exercises some<lb/>
             caution in interdating.
             </p>
             <p>
             “You can ask a girl out right<lb/>
             away--if you like getting shot<lb/>
             down!” he commented. “But most<lb/>
             of the time in your associations<lb/>
             you basically know who would<lb/>
             (go out with you) and who<lb/>
             wouldn’t,” he said. If a Negro<lb/>
             boy and a white girl get to know<lb/>
             each other and build up an <choice><orig>ex-
             change</orig><reg>exchange</reg></choice>,<lb/>
             "you ask her out then."
             </p>
             <p>
             Among the students <choice><orig>interview-
             ed</orig><reg>interviewed</reg></choice>,<lb/>
             boys have interdated more<lb/>
             frequently than girls. One coed<lb/>
             who has been asked out by white<lb/>
             boys has always “declined. I<lb/>
             might feel a little strange,” she<lb/>
             explained, “but the person I am<lb/>
             with might feel worse.”
             </p>
             <p>
             "My father just wouldn’t <choice><orig>ap-
             prove</orig><reg>approve</reg></choice>,”<lb/>
             offered another coed.<lb/>
             “I am not going to say ‘No, I<lb/>
             never will interdate.’ If it comes<lb/>
             along, I might. But... I think<lb/>
             the chances are less for me<lb/>
             than for a Negro boy.”
             </p>
             <p>
             Most of these Negroes have<lb/>
             definite views about the colored<lb/>
             students who sit together in the<lb/>
             Main Dining Hall and in the <choice><orig>Stu-
             dent</orig><reg>Student</reg></choice><lb/>
             Union. “It’s sociological,”<lb/>
             explained one Negro. “These<lb/>
             kids, for the most part, come<lb/>
             from schools where there were<lb/>
             90 per cent Negroes. They have<lb/>
             never been in an integrated <choice><orig>en-
             vironment</orig><reg>environment</reg></choice><lb/>
             and therefore remain<lb/>
             together here.”
             </p>
             <p>
             “They're mostly commuters<lb/>
             (in the Union)," analyzed <choice><orig>an-
             other</orig><reg>another</reg></choice>.<lb/>
             “They just go to the Union<lb/>
             because there is really nothing<lb/>
             else for them to do in between<lb/>
             classes--except to study. You<lb/>
             can’t do that all the time, and<lb/>
             it is nice to relax in the Union.”
             </p>
             <p>
             "To me, the Student Union<lb/>
             Negro is the Negro that every<lb/>
             body expects to see,” asserted<lb/>
             a Negro coed with much <choice><orig>resent-
             ment</orig><reg>resentment</reg></choice>.<lb/>
             “I don’t go to the Union,”<lb/>
             she continued. "I don’t care to<lb/>
             classify myself. I find it <choice><orig>posi-
             tively</orig><reg>positively</reg></choice><lb/>
             revolting. All my people<lb/>
             are congregated in one section<lb/>
             playing pinochle, laughing and<lb/>
             talking.
             </p>
             <p>
             "When I sit with the Negroes<lb/>
             in the dining hall," she added,<lb/>
             "they make me feel more like a<lb/>
             Negro than white people do."<lb/>
             A Negro clique, she said, <choice><orig>im-
             plies</orig><reg>implies</reg></choice><lb/>
             that "the white world has<lb/>
             me down and I have to go hunt<lb/>
             up my people.”
             </p>
             <p>
             "I picked the University of<lb/>
             Maryland as opposed to Negro<lb/>
             colleges in Baltimore. I still<lb/>
             have to live in a white man’s<lb/>
             world, therefore I have to learn<lb/>
             to live with them. The only way<lb/>
             you can let people know that you<lb/>

             "These were my friends in high<lb/>
             school,” professed one boy. "I<lb/>
             came to college and stayed with<lb/>
             them. It’s natural to stay with<lb/>
             people you know. Many white<lb/>
             students segregate themselves,<lb/>
             too, and only stay with people<lb/>
             they associated with prior to<lb/>
             college.”

             The Negro community on <choice><orig>cam-
             pus</orig><reg>campus</reg></choice><lb/>
             is not homogeneous in ideas--<lb/>
             nor can the Negro community<lb/>
             be considered an identifiable sub-<lb/>
             group. Some Negro students<lb/>
             stay segregated. Others <choice><orig>inte-
             grate</orig><reg>integrate</reg></choice><lb/>
             to varying degrees. Like<lb/>
             all individuals, each Negro has<lb/>
             a distinct set of opinions. Even<lb/>
             college holds a different place<lb/>
             in each one’s scheme of values.

             "I think college is a place<lb/>
             where you do a lot of learning,"<lb/>
             expressed one Negro. "All your<lb/>
             life you have been taught this and<lb/>
             that. Now your intellect begins<lb/>
             to take over... You learn whether<lb/>
             it was all a big hoax."

             In this generation, he reflected,<lb/>
             there are many opportunities for<lb/>

             many more opportunities<lb/>

             "Sooner or later I hope <choice><orig>every-

             will be one big happy family<lb/>

             “Or, then again, we<lb/>
