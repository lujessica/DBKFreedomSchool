<hr>

<p>In previous studies, I have argued that the idea of <i>freedom</i> has been integral to rhetoric by and about black and African Americans. In the context of American chattel slavery, the presumption of a natural right to freedom was constrained by expressed commitments to republican character, formal education, "free" labor, and legal citizenship. These prerequisites were used to rationalize the exclusion of African Americans--both free and enslaved--from national belonging, as well as justify the bondage and violent dehumanization of black people. However, they also provided a vocabulary by which black and white abolitionists began to challenge the practice and principles of enslavement.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Civil War, freedom's legacy as an exclusionary, rather than inclusionary, idea was brought to the forefront of American public discourse. The Union's <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/emancipation-proclamation" target="new">military strategy</a> had emancipated millions of African Americans formerly held in bondage, demanding a renegotiation of freedom and the American social contract. However, with the Freedmen's Bureau supervising the former slaves' transition, freedom once again was used to delay, if not deny altogether, the rights and privileges that black people inherently deserved. <a href="http://www.freedmensbureau.com" target="new">The Freedmen's Bureau</a>, led by Head Commissioner Oliver Otis Howard, argued that freedom would remain unfulfilled until former slaves attained <b>land, labor, education, relief, and justice</b>. They implemented policies that reaffirmed antebellum, anti-black practices of <b>classification, confinement, and control</b>--under the guise of helping the freedmen <i>earn</i> their new status. In doing so, they laid a post-bellum foundation for systematic state violence against black and African Americans; acting as government agents, the Bureau invoked arguments that deemed black people unfit for freedom.</p>
<p>Such notions of freedom have continued to shape American public discourse and, especially, arguments about the status, rights, and privileges of black and African Americans. For instance, commitments to education  only inspired the Bureau to establish and support "freedmen's school's" in the former Confederate South, which were later revived as "Freedom Schools" during the mid-twentieth century civil rights movement. These institutions attracted an immense amount of controversy, as various audiences sought to hinder African American students' right to education. Schools became a battleground for freedom.</p>
<p>While these institutions unsurprisingly placed a strong emphasis on the importance of education as a prerequisite, or precursor, to free life, they also extended freedom's legacy in other ways.</p>
<p>The history of the <a href="http://umd.edu" target="new">University of Maryland, College Park</a> is marked by a long and difficult struggle to support black and African Americans' right to education. Formerly a segregated university, UMD has historically discriminated against black and African American students who have encountered--and resisted--racially prejudicial and abusive treatment from their fellow peers, faculty, and administrators. A 1967 series in the campus newspaper, <a href="http://www.dbk.org" target="new">The Diamondback</a>, demonstrates how black and African Americans, in the struggle for education, also argued for their right to assert freedom's other attainments, especially land, labor, and justice.</p>
<p><b>Ultimately, <i>The Diamondback</i>'s 1967 series demonstrates how legacies of freedom continue to shape American public discourse about black and African Americans and further suggests that American colleges and universities, beyond upholding the significance of education, also emerge as a battleground in the ongoing struggle to fulfill <i>all</i> of freedom's promises</b>. Freedom continues to provide a vocabulary by which we discuss, critique, and analyze African Americans' experiences in the past, present, and future.</p>

<h5><i>"The Negro On Campus": A Series on African American Student Life at the University of Maryland</i></h4>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://lujessica.github.io/DBKFreedomSchool/pages/01051967.html">January 5, 1967</a>: The series's first article, "The Negro on Campus," details African American students' attempts to challenge the university's segregation policies. The account animates commitments to <i>education</i>, as well as <i>justice</i>, as students were forced to pursue lengthy court battles in order to have their voices heard.<br>
        <li><a href="https://lujessica.github.io/DBKFreedomSchool/pages/01061967.html">January 6, 1967</a>:"Integration at College Park" continues with a history of students' efforts to force legisative efforts to uphold the <i>Brown v. Board</i> ruling, with an added focus on the ways in which segregation would impact students' preparation for professional <i>labor</i>.<br>
        <li><a href="https://lujessica.github.io/DBKFreedomSchool/pages/01091967.html">January 9, 1967</a>: In "Negroes on White Campus: Apprehension limits racial interaction," students offer their views about living on a predominantly white campus. Issues related to <i>land</i>, or the ability for black and African Americans to freely maintain a safe and stable home, come to the fore.<br>
        <li><a href="https://lujessica.github.io/DBKFreedomSchool/pages/01111967.html">January 11, 1967</a>: In "Racial issues down since 1954," <i>The Diamondback</i> turns its focus squarely to racially-motivated decisionmaking regarding <i>land</i>, in turns of housing; <i>labor</i>, in terms of hiring practices; and <i>education</i>, in terms of admissions policies.<br>
        <li><a href="https://lujessica.github.io/DBKFreedomSchool/pages/01121967.html">January 12, 1967</a>: "A lonely walk?: Negroes view campus with mixed emotions" collects the various opinions of African American students at UMD, showcasing their concerns about a range of everyday, freedom-inflected issues: <i>land</i>, <i>labor</i>, and <i>education</i>.<br>
        <li><a href="https://lujessica.github.io/DBKFreedomSchool/pages/01131967.html">January 13, 1967</a>: The last article in the series, "Interdating: The Negro point of view," crystallizes students' views regarding interracial dating on campus. While these issues are set against a backdrop of <i>education</i>, they highlight another possible dimension of freedom: the ability to <i>associate</i> freely with one's peers without redress or retaliation.<br>
